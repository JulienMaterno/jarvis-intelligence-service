# Aaron Pütting: Comprehensive Profile
*Compiled January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Aaron Pütting is a 26-year-old German industrial engineer navigating a deliberate career transition after leaving Algenie, an Australian microalgae climate tech startup where he served as employee #3. Having rejected traditional consulting offers from Roland Berger and Monitor Deloitte, he's exploring three primary pathways: founding his own startup (long-term preference), joining a VC firm (1-2 year timeline), or building a small side business first. His focus areas span FoodTech, AgriTech, BioTech, Climate Tech, and Longevity sectors, driven by a shift from "blind ambition" to "moral ambition" and preference for tangible impact over pure scaling.

Currently based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Aaron is systematically researching Southeast Asian startup ecosystems while building "Jarvis," his personal AI operating system—a project he can't stop working on despite recognizing it may be a form of "productive procrastination."

## Part 2: Personality & Psychological Profile

### Cognitive Architecture

Aaron operates on what can be called **"Optimizer's Paradox"**—a cognitive pattern that is simultaneously his superpower and his trap:

**The Pattern:**
1. Encounters a decision or situation
2. First reaction is usually correct (emotional/intuitive)
3. Immediately doubts this reaction and builds analytical frameworks
4. Frameworks become so sophisticated they create their own gravity
5. Mistakes the quality of analysis for correctness of direction
6. Later realizes gut was right all along

**Evidence:**
- Revoked consulting contract days before it started (gut decision, rationalized later)
- Left Algenie when he finally admitted "I don't feel alive in it" (emotion, not spreadsheet)
- The fish speaker pivot—knew immediately it was nonsense, still spent days analyzing

### Core Personality Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cognitive Style** | Highly analytical, first-principles thinker, iterative learner |
| **Decision-Making** | Rational surface, emotional core; uses analysis to validate gut decisions |
| **Work Ethic** | Disciplined, structured, strong follow-through, proactive problem solver |
| **Communication** | Direct yet considerate; prefers concise, well-thought-out exchanges |
| **Self-Image** | High-performing but humble; occasionally self-critical or prone to over-optimization |

### Motivators & Values

**Primary Motivators:**
- Intellectual growth and engineering elegance
- Impact in sustainability and climate
- Community and belonging (non-negotiable, learned from Algenie)
- Autonomy combined with connection

**Core Values:**
- Realism over blind optimism
- Accuracy, follow-through, and consistency
- Authentic communication over polished positioning
- Impact over scale ("Would rather NOT scale if it means having a bigger impact")

**Frustrations:**
- Vagueness and inefficiency
- Surface-level conversation
- People who don't deliver what they promise
- Environments without energy or trust

### Emotional Architecture: The Algenie Revelation

Aaron's Algenie experience revealed a fundamental equation:

**What he thought:**
```
Impact + Autonomy = Fulfillment
```

**What he learned:**
```
Impact + Autonomy + Belonging = Fulfillment
(And Belonging is NOT optional)
```

He left Algenie not because the mission was wrong, but because he stopped feeling *alive* in it. The isolation, despite meaningful work, became unbearable.

**His own words:** *"Mission gives purpose; people give life."*

This is arguably the most important personal learning from his career so far.

### The "Controlled Chaos" Pattern

Aaron deliberately places himself in uncertain situations across countries and domains, then systematically builds infrastructure to thrive. He has lived and built networks in:
- Germany
- Sweden (exchange)
- China (Tsinghua)
- Australia (Algenie)
- Southeast Asia (current)

This pattern suggests someone who is comfortable with discomfort but needs to *engineer* his way through uncertainty.

---

## Part 3: The Algenie Story

### How It Started: The "Wrong Turn" to Australia

Aaron was supposed to go to Vietnam for his German thesis at a startup. Instead, through a spreadsheet mishap, he ended up interviewing with an Australian fish farming startup (Aquacultr) that he mistakenly thought was in Vietnam.

**The Psychedelic Fish Speaker Incident:**

On his first day at Aquacultr, the CEO revealed he had taken mushrooms two weeks prior. During his trip, he "talked to water" and learned that "fish would like some music." The entire business model was pivoting to build underwater speakers for fish.

After five days of investigation, Aaron quit. The "research" showed:
1. No scientific evidence for music calming fish
2. Volume requirements would damage fish hearing
3. No way to measure if fish are actually calmed

This left Aaron stranded in Newcastle, Australia, with a lease and no thesis project.

### Finding Algenie

After breaking his lease and moving to Sydney with a deadline of end-of-October, Aaron found Algenie through LinkedIn outreach. He met the founders (Nick and John) at a café, and they said: "You can start now."

He didn't sign anything that day. They just went to the lab and started building. *"So un-German."*

### The Ironic Twist

Two weeks after starting at Algenie, his German university confirmed they would acknowledge his Chinese thesis for the German degree. He no longer needed to write a second thesis—the entire reason for going to Australia.

Instead of leaving, Aaron chose to stay because he genuinely enjoyed the work and believed in the mission.

### Why He Eventually Left (October-November 2025)

**Loss of Trust in Nick:**
- Unrealistic optimism disconnected from facts
- Repeated patterns of "this customer/investor is basically confirmed" that turned out unfounded
- Talked too much without saying enough
- Wasted time on non-priorities despite urgency

**Key Realization:** Aaron was often right when he disagreed with Nick's decisions, despite initially deferring due to his limited experience. *"I kept thinking: It cannot be that I was right so often. This is just not how it should be."*

**Team Dynamics:**
- Felt like "a bunch of fighters for the same mission, but not a team"
- High autonomy became isolation
- No psychological safety or collective energy
- Missing role models on the business side (Nick and Renske didn't deliver the mentorship he expected)

**The Deloitte Dinner Contrast:**
A dinner with former Deloitte colleagues made everything clear. Within minutes, he felt welcomed, connected, energized—that sense of *community around work* he'd been starving for.

**Final Lesson:** Meaningful work isn't enough without shared energy.

## Part 4: Current Situation & Career Exploration

### Where He Is Now (January 2026)

**Geographic Journey:**
- December 5-24, 2025: Bali, Indonesia ("Coming to Bali was a mistake")
- December 25-30, 2025: Jakarta, Indonesia (systematic ecosystem exploration)
- December 31-January 1: Return to Bali, then flight change to leave early
- January 1 onwards: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

**Physical Setbacks in December:**
- Broken Apple Watch
- Injured shoulder tendons (still preventing most sports)
- Bali belly (first week)
- Cold
- Random infection (spent NYE in bed with fever)

**Newsletter:** "Exploring Out Loud" - 4 editions published, documenting his journey with authentic vulnerability

### The Three Career Paths

**Path 1: Found Own Startup (Long-term preference)**
- But needs to find problems worth solving first
- "Feel urge to build rather than invest"
- Currently "tending towards building things"

**Path 2: Join VC (1-2 year learning path)**
- Learn investor perspective before own startup
- Build network, understand fundraising side
- **MAJOR CONCERN: Loneliness** - Could recreate Algenie isolation

**Path 3: Build Small Side Business First**
- Something buildable in few months
- Maintain on side while pursuing options 1 or 2

### Target Sectors

| Sector | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **FoodTech** | Sustainable food systems, alternative proteins |
| **AgriTech** | Technology-enabled agriculture, precision farming |
| **BioTech** | Deep tech solutions with real-world impact |
| **Climate Tech** | Carbon removal, renewable energy, sustainable materials |
| **Longevity** | Health optimization, preventive medicine |

**Philosophy:** Prioritizing impact-driven, tangible solutions over generic B2B SaaS. As Bill Gates suggests: if a startup can't potentially remove 1 gigaton of CO₂ per year in its best-case scenario, what's the point?

### The VC Question (Unresolved)

**Why VC appeals:**
- Breaking into Singapore (visa pathway, network)
- Networking as the job
- Learn to invest (long-term angel investor goal)
- See fundraising side before own startup

**Why VC concerns him:**
- **🚩 Loneliness (biggest issue)** - Could recreate Algenie isolation
- Inauthentic networking (people know you have money)
- Time investment (1-2 years, would be 28+ before launching)

**The Deeper Truth (from our conversations):**
VC might be "consulting 2.0"—a socially impressive middle path that delays founder commitment and keeps options open. It has clear guardrails, clear tasks, and he knows what he'd be doing. Startup has massive uncertainty.

**His own realization:** *"I feel like the entire path of building a startup excites me more... If I were VC, I would get annoyed watching other people building shit."*

### Current Applications

1. **Entrepreneurs First (EF) London** - Residency program
2. **Antler** - Startup accelerator
3. **Network School** - Alternative program

All three submitted with uncertainty: "Not sure these are right for me."

### Geographic Considerations

| Location | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Singapore** | Biotech/regulated industries, strong VC scene, only viable SEA option for deep tech | Expensive, harder entry |
| **Vietnam** | Cost-effective, growing ecosystem, more direct communication, walkable | Early stage, limited deep tech infrastructure |
| **Indonesia** | Large market | Extreme price sensitivity, relationship-based, corruption, talent challenges |
| **Munich** | Hardware/deep tech | Distance from SEA ecosystem |
| **San Francisco** | Tech hub, B2B software | Political/cultural concerns, expensive |

**Key Insight from Market Research:**
Vietnam is consistently recommended over Indonesia by multiple sources. Indonesia challenges include:
- $3 switching cost kills customer loyalty
- Corruption (government/police involvement)
- Yes-saying culture vs. direct communication
- Work ethics concerns
- Fragmented agriculture

**The Singapore-Vietnam-Indonesia Framework:**
*"Singapore money, Vietnam build, Indonesia ship"*

### The Value Alignment Discovery

A major reflection (January 2026) revealed a fundamental conflict:

**Traditional VC requires:** 100x returns, massive scale

**Aaron wants:** Impact over scale, even if it means not scaling

**His exact words:** *"Would rather NOT scale if it means having a bigger impact, than scale with a lower impact."*

This suggests he may be fundamentally misaligned with traditional VC models and should explore:
- Focused Research Organizations (FROs)
- Philanthropic funding (Emergent Ventures, Schmidt Futures)
- Impact-first VCs (Breakthrough Energy Ventures)

## Part 5: Project Jarvis

### What It Is

"Jarvis" is Aaron's personal AI operating system—a unified knowledge graph connecting conversations, meetings, reflections, emails, and tasks. Named after Iron Man's AI assistant.

**Vision:** *"The future belongs to those who build their memory today."*

**The Thesis:** Everyone will eventually have a personal AI that truly knows them. The advantage goes to those who build their data infrastructure now—because even perfect future alternatives will need one thing: years of contextual data.

### Technical Architecture

**Current Stack:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) as single source of truth
- Bidirectional sync across Notion, Google Contacts, Apple Reminders, Google Tasks
- WhisperX transcription pipeline for voice memos
- Claude MCP integration for natural language queries
- Beeper integration for unified messaging

**Four-Phase Roadmap:**

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Data Hub** | Unified database, redirect all pipelines | Mostly complete |
| **Phase 2: Jarvis First Steps** | Telegram interface, queries, daily digests | In progress |
| **Phase 3: RAG & Deep Context** | Vector embeddings, semantic search | Future |
| **Phase 4: Real Jarvis** | Voice interface, proactive AI | Future |

### What He Built in December 2025

✅ **Completed:**
- Supabase database as single source of truth
- Contact sync (Supabase ↔ Notion ↔ Google Contacts)
- Plot Chrome extension integration (LinkedIn scraping)
- Smart evening journal with context-aware prompts
- Beeper integration
- Supabase MCP server for Claude Desktop

🔄 **In Progress:**
- Transcription pipeline redirect
- Tasks sync across 4 systems
- Email & calendar sync

### The Self-Awareness Paradox

Aaron recognizes three patterns in his Jarvis obsession:

**1. Productive Procrastination:**
> *"There are probably more important things right now than Project Jarvis. I'm wondering whether I'm procrastinating from those things... Probably one of the most productive procrastinations ever, but still a procrastination."*

**2. Keeping Options Open (Again):**
> *"I had the habit of always keeping all doors open. That's why I chose generic mechanical engineering. That's why I went into consulting. If Project Jarvis does the same because it helps 'whatever I do next,' it sounds like the same habit. Suspicious."*

**3. Inability to Rest:**
> *"I was not supposed to do this in December. Focus was on rest and reflection. But my way of rest seems to be, at minimum, building exciting systems. I'm really bad at feeling unproductive."*

**His conclusion:**
> *"Don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no doubts that Project Jarvis is great and useful. But I'm aware of the pattern now, and reflecting on this is probably progress in itself? Anyway, I am too excited about this project to stop building entirely!"*

### The Interest Disconnect

**The Central Question:**
Why does someone who wants to solve world hunger spend all his time building productivity tools?

**Stated interests:** FoodTech, AgriTech, BioTech, Climate, Longevity (all altruistic, world-hunger-solving)

**What he can't stop building:** Jarvis (a productivity tool, a personal tool)

**Possible Interpretations:**
1. Jarvis IS the thing (follow the energy)
2. Jarvis is procrastination from harder career decisions
3. Jarvis is infrastructure that enables everything else
4. Jarvis represents his desire to keep options open

## Part 8: Core Learnings & Principles

### From Algenie Experience

1. **Autonomy only works when paired with belonging** - Freedom without shared purpose and connection drains energy instead of fueling it

2. **Need environments with energy and trust, not just mission alignment** - Competence and shared excitement matter as much as impact

3. **Community matters more than expected** - Thrives when surrounded by people who communicate openly, challenge him, and share real camaraderie

4. **Values realism over blind optimism** - Credibility is built on accuracy, follow-through, and consistency

5. **Can sense cultural energy deeply** - When the "room feels alive," performs at best; when it doesn't, motivation drops

### Decision-Making Patterns Identified

**Analysis Theater:**
Uses elaborate analytical frameworks to validate emotional decisions already made. Gets seduced by own planning process—psychological commitment happens during planning.

**Keeping Options Open:**
Pattern from mechanical engineering → consulting → Jarvis "useful for anything." Recognizes this but continues the pattern.

**Gut Reliability:**
When forced to make gut decisions (changing flights, leaving Algenie), they tend to be correct. Should trust intuition more.

**Optimization Over Choice:**
Naturally inclined to optimize around problems rather than solve them directly. At Algenie, built morning routines to compensate for team dysfunction rather than addressing it.

### Key Realizations

**On Impact vs. Scale:**
> *"Would rather NOT scale if it means having a bigger impact, than scale with a lower impact."*

**On Technical Talent:**
> *"Technical talent is being systematically misallocated."*

(This may be about himself)

**On the US/SF:**
Political and cultural concerns are making him question whether he wants to build in the US ecosystem at all.

## Part 9: Unresolved Questions & Tensions

### Career Path Tensions

1. **VC still "on the table"** despite clarity that building excites him more
2. **Jarvis continuing** despite saying he'd cut it before networking
3. **"What to build" uncertainty** keeping VC door open
4. **Applications to 3 programs** without certainty they're right
5. **Stated interests** (FoodTech, Climate, Longevity) vs. **actual building** (productivity tools)
6. **People/belonging non-negotiable** but currently building solo

### The Identity Crisis

Aaron is in the gap between two identities:

**Old Identity:** "High-performing generalist who keeps options open"
- Consulting was perfect for this
- Double master's, multiple internships, never committing to one path

**New Identity:** "Mission-driven builder/founder"
- Requires closing doors, accepting trade-offs
- Demands specific expertise, not generalist breadth
- Means saying "this is who I am"

**Current State:** Recreating the "keeping options open" pattern at a higher level

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Why are you so afraid of the Jarvis obsession being legitimate?** What if "the thing I can't stop building even when I know I should be doing something else" is exactly the signal you should follow?

2. **What would you build if you weren't trying to solve world hunger?** The disconnect between stated interests (altruistic) and actual building (personal tools) is significant.

3. **The VC question feels like Roland Berger 2.0.** After everything learned about needing community, why still entertaining a path with massive loneliness risk?

4. **What decision would make this month different from last month?** Self-awareness alone isn't progress if it doesn't lead to action.

5. **Where do you want to spend Christmas 2026?** Geographic commitment reveals deeper commitments.

6. **If Jarvis didn't exist as an option, what decision would you make about the next 6 months?**

## Part 10: The Meta-Profile

### What Makes Aaron Unique

**The Rare Combination:**
- Technical depth (biotech, engineering, systems thinking)
- Business capability (strategy, modeling, fundraising, due diligence)
- Cross-cultural experience (Germany, China, Australia, SEA)
- Can code AND understand VC perspectives

**The Superpower:** Systematic ecosystem penetration. Rapidly builds networks and comprehensive databases when entering new markets or domains.

**The Trap:** Gets seduced by own analytical processes. Mistakes the quality of analysis for the correctness of direction.

### The Fundamental Question

> **"What's the highest and best use of Aaron right now?"**

Not "what job should I take" but "what problem pulls me forward?"

He has all the self-awareness. He sees the patterns. He recognizes the analysis theater. What he needs now is someone to push him past recognition into actual decision.

### The Path Forward

**Stop exploring "whether" and start exploring "how":**

Instead of: "Should I do VC or startup or FRO?"
Ask: "What problem am I actually excited to solve, and what's the best structure to solve it?"

Instead of: "Which geography/program should I choose?"
Ask: "Where are the people building the things I care about in the way I want to build them?"

Instead of: "Am I investable by VCs?"
Ask: "What funding models exist for impact-first work that doesn't compromise?"
